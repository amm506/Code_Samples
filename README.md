# Code_Samples

The folder 'CodeSample2" contains 3 C files, which I was given in the TI-RSLK-Max Curriculum. The header file was not created by or modified by me. Reflectance.c and Lab06_GPIOmain.c were modified by me. There is also the lab writeup, which gives a breif overview of the Lab assignment. I added this to give context to my "Lab setup", the robot itself, and the tools that I used such as Texas Instruments Logic Analyzer and the debugger.

Design Project 2 is in C++, but was created in the Arudino IDE, so it shows as an .ino file. I added some comments into the file itself for clarity.
